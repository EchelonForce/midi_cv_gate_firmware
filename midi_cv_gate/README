Structure is weird because of Arduino IDE. All the .ino files are concatenated
and built as one file, so the varioun MODE options are surrounded by compiler
flags to keep things them from interfere with each other and to allow the
shared.ino to be used in multiple builds.

midi_cv_gate.ino is the normal mode.

test_cv_gate.ino is a test that doesn't rely on MIDI input and cycles outptus
through voltages and on off states. It prints some information to serial.

test_midi.ino is a test of midi input and output circuitry. It transmits note
on/off messages and when a note on/off message is recieved it displays the
note and velocity on the gate outputs.
