/*
DAC_CAL_VALS should be a 2-D array [GATE_CV_CNT][MIDI_NOTE_CNT].
This array is unfortunately large than the Arduino's EEPROM, so it has to be set at compile time;
meaning, calibration has to be done and the device re-programmed with the calibrated values.

The first entry for each DAC/CV must be positive.

Each value is a signed offset used to fine tune the conversion of a MIDI note (0-127) to a DAC value.
The conversion of notes to DAC values uses CAL_FACTOR as a scale factor and then adds
the offset from DAC_CAL_VALS.

CAL_FACTOR is DAC uints per semitone * 100. See noteValueToCV().
*/

/*
Calibration requires zeros in DAC_CAL_VALS and a sensible default for CAL_FACTOR.
Set CALIBRATION = 1 here to use such defaults. Once the calbration is done and
CAL_FACTOR and DAC_CAL_VALS determined for the device, set CALIBRATION =0 and
replace "replace_after_cal" below.
